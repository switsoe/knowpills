A full complement of these essential micronutrients is particularly important when the body is undergoing physical and biochemical stress, such as occurs during opioid withdrawal.

Therefore, a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement may be recommended for those withdrawing from opioids. However, there is no research demonstrating that use of these supplements eases the discomfort of withdrawal.");
